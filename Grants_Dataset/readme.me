A project from my Data Science and Pattern Regonition course taken at Northern Illinois University. The fist file contains a jupyter 
notebook containing code used for data cleaning, feature extraction and predictions. The second file is the report detailing all
process used in the analysis, results from the analysis and the relevance of these results.
